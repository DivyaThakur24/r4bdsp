All definitions and data come from the original Udacity lesson and can be found here. 3.1.1 Data We start by assigning our data to Petals, a list of petal counts from flowers. Petals &lt;- c(15, 16, 17, 16, 21, 22, 15, 16, 15, 17, 16, 22, 14, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15, 14, 15, 16, 10, 19, 15, 15, 22, 24, 25, 15, 16) 3.1.2 Frequency The frequency of a data set is the number of times a certain outcome occurs. # Find the most frequent petal count. # to do this we create a table from Petals, sort it in decreasing order, and get the name of the first item. MostFreq &lt;- names(sort(table(Petals),decreasing=TRUE)[1]) print(paste0(&quot;The most frequent petal count is: &quot;, MostFreq)) #&gt; [1] &quot;The most frequent petal count is: 15&quot; # Find the frequency of flowers with 15 petals. # We can use the same method as above but without the names PetalFreq &lt;- sort(table(Petals),decreasing=TRUE)[1] print(paste0(&quot;The frequency of flowers with 15 petals is: &quot;, PetalFreq)) #&gt; [1] &quot;The frequency of flowers with 15 petals is: 9&quot; 3.1.3 Proportions A proportion is the fraction of counts over the total sample. # Find the proportion of flowers with 15 petals TotalSample &lt;- length(Petals) PetalProp &lt;- PetalFreq/TotalSample print(paste0(&quot;The proportion of flowers with 15 petals is: &quot;, PetalProp)) #&gt; [1] &quot;The proportion of flowers with 15 petals is: 0.3&quot; 3.1.4 Percentage A proportion can be turned into a percentage by multiplying the proportion by 100. # Find the percentage of flowers with 15 petals PetalPerc &lt;- PetalProp * 100 print(paste0(&quot;The percentage of flowers with 15 petals is: &quot;, PetalPerc, &quot;%&quot;)) #&gt; [1] &quot;The percentage of flowers with 15 petals is: 30%&quot; 3.1.5 Histogram A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of data, discrete intervals (bins) are decided upon to form widths for our boxes. R has the hist() function to make basic histograms. Here are some very simple examples. # Create a histogram with a bin size of 2 hist(Petals, breaks = (length(Petals)/2), col = &quot;blue&quot;) # Create a histogram with a bin size of 5 bins &lt;- c(10,15,20,25,30) #hist(Petals, breaks = (length(Petals)/5)) hist(Petals, breaks = bins, col = &quot;orange&quot;) 3.1.6 Skew Positive Skew - A positive skew is when outliers are present along the right most end of the distribution. The histogram for Petals is an example of a positive skew Negative Skew - A negative skew is when outliers are present along the left most end of the distribution 3.2 Lesson 4 Variability 3.2.1 Data 3.2.2 Interquartile range 3.2.3 Box Plot 3.2.4 Outliers 3.2.5 Variance 3.2.6 Standard Deviation 3.3 Lesson 6 Normal Distribution 3.3.1 Probability Distribution Function. 3.3.1.1 Data 3.3.1.2 Create a density plot 3.3.2 Finding the probability 3.3.2.1 Z-Score 3.3.2.2 Proportion using a z-table 3.3.2.3 Proportion using pnorm 3.3.2.4 Plotting the percentage 3.3.2.5 Proportion of a range "]
